            <p class="hold">I was in my third year of university when first got interested in computers. Before then I was content with basic computer literacy and I didn't really pay much attention to the field prior to then. When I wrote a simple java calculator after
                reading <em>Java Programming For Dummies</em> , I got really interested in programming and wanted to know how deep the rabbit hole went.</p>
